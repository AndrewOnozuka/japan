                Despite being born and raised in San Diego, California, my two fully Japanese immigrant parents made sure I learned Japanese and stayed in touch with my cultural heritage.
                Every Saturday for 11 years, I attended a supplementary Japanese school in San Diego called Minato Gakuen, where we learned a wide variety of subjects from Japanese language,
                history, geography and politics, in addition to the more universal math, science, etc. Instruction was only in Japanese and combined with the Japanese spoken at home, I am
                blessed to say that I have retained fluency of the language. I also lived in Japan for 2 years prior to entering first grade, when my family moved to Japan before eventually moving back.<br>
                <br>
                I have also been invited to speak as a representative of my class on multiple occasions throughout the years, most recently when I gave a speech at Balboa Park's Japanese Friendship Garden
                here in San Diego for our coming of age ceremony, known as Seijinshiki (成人式). Below is a picture of me during my speech as well as our group photo of all of the coming of age recepients.

                <h2 id="opt1">Considering Going?</h2>
                I'm obviously biased but I think Japan is a great place to visit. More people will try to visit as pandemic restrictions ease, so maybe now is the time to go!?<br>
                <br>

                <h2 id="opt2">Decided to go but haven't booked anything. How long is a good duration and where should I go?</h2>
                If it's within your budget, I highly recommend staying at least 2 weeks. I think 3 weeks was perfect for me and I was traveling alone, granted I speak Japanese and had no issues communicating.
                It may be daunting if you don't understand Japanese in the slightest, but Google has come a long way and especially in the urban areas around Tokyo, there will be no shortage of tourist stations where there are
                multilingual workers stationed to serve whatever questions you may have. If you need any help mapping out your rough timeline, you can look at my travel log from my trip over the summer of 2022, or just ask me to help as well.<br>
                <br>
                Where you should go depends very much on the experience you are looking for. If you want to experience the nightlife and are an avid drinker, staying around Tokyo and going clubbing every night may sound like the dream.
                For me though, I highly recommend spending more or most of your time towards Kyoto and Osaka. The location of both international airports in Japan (Haneda - HND & Narita - NRT) will force you to go through Tokyo no matter what,
                so my recommendation is to spend a couple days exploring Tokyo either when you first arrive or right before you depart. With that being said: there is no right or wrong way to travel, and if you do end up staying in Tokyo do not worry,
                there will be absolutely no shortage of things to do.

                <h2 id="opt3" class="warning">IMPORTANT INFO</h2>
                Preferred Airport:<br>
                If you haven't booked your flights yet and assuming that the availability/convenience does not change, try to fly into Haneda International Airport (HND) instead of Narita (NRT). There is nothing wrong with Narita,
                but it is further away and you will spend precious time on your trip on the trains to get into the city first. Trust me, you will have enough time on trains and traveling on cool public transit during the remainder of your trip.
                In other words, assuming all other variables equal (price, travel dates, times, etc.) you should prioritize Haneda over Narita.<br>
                <br>
                Wifi/Internet Connection:<br>
                Most places in Japan do have free wifi, such as hotels and cafes. However, to effectively communicate with the rest of the world, I recommend you figure out some way to have data while you are in Japan. You can look up many services
                where you can simply pick up a prepaid "pocket" wifi from vendors and network companies at the airport. The more convenient ones tend to get a little more pricey, but if you look you can definitely find some solid deals.<br>
                <br>
                Japan Railways Pass (most commonly known as the JR PASS):<br>
                This may be the most important thing I have to tell any people visiting Japan (assuming they are not Japanese/own a foreign passport). As you hopefully are aware, Japan has an unmatched high quality public transport. Specifically for the subways and trains,
                there are usually two types of lines: public and private. The public railway company in Japan is called JR, short for Japan Railways. Aside from the occassional times where you have to use private lines, the MAJORITY of your travel will likely
                make use of the public lines. This is where the JR pass comes in. The JR pass is an absolute steal limited only to people who are not Japanese citizens. Prices vary for different lengths of the pass, but for example I used one that cost me $150
                which granted me 2 weeks of unlimited rides on anything JR, from subways to busses to bullet trains. Taking one round trip on a bullet train alone would have cost me the entire $150 had I not gotten the pass. Long story short, there is almost no
                scenario I can think of where it would be cheaper to not buy the pass. Please look into the pass and abuse it while you are in Japan. There are different passes for different regions as well, so if you know you will stay within one region there is
                no need to get the one that allows you to go anywhere in Japan. When you redeem the pass, you get a small ticket that is extremely powerful and valuable. Please be careful to not drop the expensive ticket, and make sure to always grab it at the end
                of the gate when you put your ticket in (it gets fed through and you can pick it up on the other side as you walk through). Sometimes there are technical difficulties so if that ever happens just go over to the side window of all of the gates where
                there is someone stationed and tell them you have a JR pass. They'll likely just let you through or reset the ticket for you if it didn't scan correctly. They probably won't bat an eye and just let you through - seriously it is that powerful.<br>
                <br>
                Private Lines/SUICA (our equivalent of Apple Pay):<br>
                In the few cases I mentioned above where there is no JR sign for a specific line, it is likely a private line. For private lines, you will have to use a touch payment app on your phone (or Apple Watch, I'm not familiar with compatibility on other devices).
                The app is called SUICA and you can simply charge the amount of money on there using Apple Pay on your phone (pretty sure I have friends who have done it with Google Pay as well, don't quote me on that though). You should 100% have this app before you leave
                for Japan. When you first arrive until you redeem your JR pass (since it must be redeemed at a JR station first), you will have to use SUICA at least once. Japanese people have this app called "Pay Pay" which is like our Venmo, but you'll likely never have
                to use that so I personally would not get it.<br>
                <br>
                Shopping & Spending with respect to USD vs JPY:<br>
                For those of you reading this (99% people I know), the US dollar is strong to the Japanese yen at the moment. At the time I am writing this, the exchange rate is roughly $0.75 for 100 yen. The "expected" rate of exchange is supposed to be $1 for 100 yen.
                As a visitor from the US who converts their money to yen, you are essentially multiplying your money by 1.34x (around 1.3 at least for the forseeable future, probably). Combined with the fact that food and cost of goods/living is already cheaper in Japan,
                almost everything will be astronomically cheaper compared to what you're used to in high-inflation American society. Spend responsibly of course, but I would recommend you do not refrain from spending for the sake of saving money. Who knows the next time
                you'll get to visit Japan!<br>

                Last but not least, don't be afraid to ask for help! The majority of Japanese people are extremely kind and willing to help. Even if there is a language barrier, be willing to ask! You never know if you'll meet any new friends.
                With that being said, I am also available to help. Granted there will be a decent time difference, I am more than happy to answer any questions that may come up during your trip and be your remote tour guide as well.
                You can text me at (858) 344-5737, just please let me know who you are if I don't already have your number. Above is all of the important info I can think of at the moment, but I will be updating this list if anything relevant comes to mind.<br>
